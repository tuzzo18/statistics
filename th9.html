        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Th9: The Poisson Processes: Meaning, Properties, Simulations</h1>

        <div class="solution">
            A <b>Poisson process</b> is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space. The essential feature of a Poisson process is that the points occur independently of one another. This process is named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Poisson process is often defined on the real line, where it can be considered as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used in queueing theory to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store, phone calls at an exchange, or occurrence of earthquakes, distributed in time.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest.
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="exercise_text">
                A <b>Poisson process</b> is a stochastic model that describes the occurrence of events in continuous time. It has the key property that the number of events in non-overlapping intervals follows a <b>Poisson distribution</b>:
                if the average number of events per interval is \(\lambda\), the probability of observing \(k\) events in an interval is given by:
                \[P_\lambda(k) = \frac{\lambda ^ k}{k!}e ^{-\lambda}\:\:\:\:\:\: \forall k \in \mathbb{N}\]
            </div>

            <br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" src="Poisson_pmf.svg.png" alt="poisson distribution">
                <p>Probability mass function (pmf)</p>
            </div>
            <p>The horizontal axis is the index k, the number of occurrences. λ is the expected rate of occurrences. The vertical axis is the probability of k occurrences given λ. The function is defined only at integer values of k; the connecting lines are only guides for the eye.</p>

            <p>The Poisson distribution is an appropriate model if the following assumptions are true:</p>
            <p>
                Let k be the number of times an event occurs in an interval and k can take values 0, 1, 2, ... .
                <br>
                <br>
                - The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability that a second event will occur. That is, events occur independently.
                <br>
                - The average rate at which events occur is independent of any occurrences. For simplicity, this is usually assumed to be constant, but may in practice vary with time.
                <br>
                - Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval, either exactly one event occurs, or no event occurs.
                <br>
                <br>
                If these conditions are true, then k is a Poisson random variable, and the distribution of k is a Poisson distribution. 
            </p>

            <h3>Poisson Process properties</h3>
            <b>1. Independence:</b> The occurrence of points in disjoint regions of the space is independent. In other words, the presence or absence of points in one region does not affect the presence or absence of points in another region.
            <br>
            <b>2. Homogeneity:</b> The average density of points is constant throughout the space. This implies that the likelihood of finding a point in a given region is proportional to the size of that region.
            <br>
            <b>3. Stationarity:</b> The statistical properties of the point process remain the same throughout the entire space. This means that any finite region of the space is statistically equivalent to any other region of the same size.

            <p><u>The Poisson point process is often used to model random events that occur independently in time or space</u>. Examples include the occurrence of phone calls at a call center, the distribution of stars in the sky, or the location of defects on a manufactured surface.</p>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            The number of chewing gums on a single tile of a sidewalk is approximately Poisson distributed.
