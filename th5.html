            All probability distributions can be classified as either <b>discrete</b> probability distributions or <b>continuous</b> probability distributions, depending on whether they define probabilities associated with discrete variables or continuous variables.
            <br>

            <div class="math-box">
                <p style="text-align: center;">A <b>random variable</b> \(X\) is a function from the sample space \(\Omega\) to the real numbers:</p>
                \[X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\]
            </div>

            So, a random variable is a function that assigns a value to all possible outcomes of an experiment.
            <br>
            <br>
            The technical axiomatic definition requires the sample space \(\Omega\) to be a sample space of a probability space (\(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P\)).
            <br>
            <br>
            A probability space consists of three elements:
            <br>
            1. A <b>sample space</b>, \(\Omega\), which is the set of all possible outcomes.
            <br>
            2. An <b>event space</b>, \(\mathcal{F}\), which is a set of events, where an event is a set of outcomes in the sample space (subset of \(\Omega\)).
            <br>
            3. A <b>probability function</b>, \(P\), which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of probability space, together with other axioms of probability, in the 1930s.

            <h4>Discrete Probability Distributions</h4>

            <div class="math-box">
                <p style="text-align: center;">A random variable \(X\) is <b>discrete</b> if it can take on a <b>finite</b> or <b>countably infinite</b> set of values.</p>
            </div>

            <u>Note</u> A set \(A\) is countable if either
            <br>
            - \(A\) is a finite set such as \(\{1,2,3,4\}\)
            <br>
            - It can be put in one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers (in this case the set is said to be countably infinite)
            <br>
            <br>
            The probability distributions of discrete variables can be expressed in terms of <b>probability mass functions</b> (pmf). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Some examples of continuous distributions include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bernoulli</b> distribution: the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability \(p\) and the value 0 with probability \(q=1-p\).</li>
                <li><b>Binomial</b> distribution: the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of \(n\) independent experiments, each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success (with probability \(p\)) or failure (with probability \(q=1-p\)). </li>
                <li><b>Poisson</b> distribution: expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Continuous Probability Distributions</h4>

            <div class="math-box">
                <p style="text-align: center;">A random variable \(X\) is <b>continuous</b> if it can take on an <b>uncountable</b> set of values.</p>
            </div>
            
            The probability distributions of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of <b>probability density functions</b> (pdf).
            <br>
            <br>
            Some examples of continuous distributions include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Uniform</b> distribution: used to represent a randomly varying quantity within a range \([a, b]\) and whose probability of taking values in a subinterval of \([a, b]\) is proportional to their length.</li>
                <li><b>Exponential</b> distribution: is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.</li>
                <li><b>Normal</b> distribution</li>
            </ul>

            Itâ€™s important to note that a continuous probability distribution differs from a discrete probability distribution in several ways. The probability that a continuous random variable will assume a particular value is zero. As a result, a continuous probability distribution cannot be expressed in tabular form. On the other hand, a discrete distribution includes values that are countable whole numbers.
